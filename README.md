# Project-cells

My attempt at creating nice-to-look-at cellular automaton.

Based on Lenia by Bert Wang-Chak Chan:

## Requirements
To run this application you'll need OpenGL installed. You can do this on linux using my script:
```shell
./deps/install-openGL.sh
```
Hopefully this will do the trick. (Of course you need `sudo` for it.)

I don't know how to install it on windows yet.

## Installation
To install and run the application use:
```shell
./build.sh
```

If you have the application installed already, use:
```shell
./run.sh
```
